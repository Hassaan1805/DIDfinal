## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Step 1: Setup (Automated)
```bash
# The setup script will:
✅ Detect system IP address automatically
✅ Install all Node.js dependencies  
✅ Configure environment files for your network
✅ Set up firewall rules (if permissions allow)
✅ Create startup and test scripts
✅ Verify everything is working
```

### Step 2: Start Platform
```bash
# Single command starts everything:
./start-platform.sh    # Linux/macOS
start-platform.bat     # Windows

# This starts:
✅ Backend on http://YOUR_IP:3001
✅ Frontend on http://YOUR_IP:5173  
✅ Mobile access via YOUR_IP:3001
```

### Step 3: Deploy Mobile App
```bash
# Transfer and install APK:
✅ Install app-release.apk on Android device
✅ Ensure device on same WiFi network
✅ App auto-discovers backend
✅ Scan QR codes for authentication
```

## 🌐 Network Configuration (Automatic)

### Backend Configuration:
- **Host**: `0.0.0.0` (accessible from all network interfaces)
- **Port**: `3001`
- **CORS**: Configured for local network access
- **Health Check**: `http://YOUR_IP:3001/api/health`

### Frontend Configuration:  
- **API Base URL**: Automatically set to `http://YOUR_IP:3001/api`
- **Development Mode**: Enabled with hot reload
- **Network Access**: `http://YOUR_IP:5173`

### Mobile App Configuration:
- **Auto-Discovery**: Scans network for backend
- **Fallback IPs**: `192.168.x.x:3001`, `localhost:3001`, `10.0.2.2:3001`
- **Network Testing**: Built-in connectivity diagnostics

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Automated Health Checks:
```bash
✅ Backend Health: GET /api/health → 200 OK
✅ Frontend Access: GET / → 200 OK  
✅ QR Generation: POST /api/auth/challenge → 200 OK
✅ Mobile Discovery: Network scan → Backend found
✅ End-to-End Auth: QR scan → Authentication success
```
