# 🔐 Zero-Knowledge Proof Implementation Guide

## Overview

This project now includes a complete **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK Proof)** system for certificate authentication. ZK proofs enable you to verify certificate ownership and attributes **without revealing sensitive information**.

## 🎯 What is Zero-Knowledge Proof?

Zero-Knowledge Proof is a cryptographic method where one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a value, without revealing the value itself.

**Example:** You can prove you own a certificate without showing your private credentials, or prove your completion date is after 2024-01-01 without revealing the exact date.

## 📋 Features Implemented

### 1. **🔑 Ownership Proof**
Prove you own a certificate without revealing your private secret/key.

**Use Cases:**
- Authentication without exposing credentials
- Secure certificate ownership verification
- Privacy-preserving identity verification

**How it works:**
1. Generate proof using serial number + owner secret
2. System creates a cryptographic commitment
3. Verifier can confirm ownership without seeing the secret

**API Endpoint:** `POST /zk/generate_ownership_proof`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "serial_number": "1111",
  "owner_secret": "my_private_key_123"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "proof_id": "abc123...",
  "commitment": "hash_value",
  "message": "Ownership proof generated successfully"
}
```

---

### 2. **🎯 Attribute Proof**
Prove an attribute satisfies a condition without revealing its actual value.

**Use Cases:**
- "My completion date is after 2024-01-01" (without showing exact date)
- "My organization contains 'University'" (without full name)
- "My certificate is not expired" (without showing expiry date)

**Supported Predicates:**
- `greater_than`: Value > predicate_value
- `less_than`: Value < predicate_value
- `equals`: Value == predicate_value
- `not_equals`: Value != predicate_value
- `contains`: predicate_value in Value

**API Endpoint:** `POST /zk/prove_attribute`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "serial_number": "1111",
  "attribute": "completion_date",
  "predicate": "greater_than",
  "value": "2024-01-01"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "proof_id": "xyz789...",
  "message": "Attribute satisfies predicate without revealing value",
  "verified": true,
  "commitment": "hash_value"
}
```

---

### 3. **🎭 Selective Disclosure**
Choose which certificate attributes to reveal and which to keep hidden using ZK proofs.

**Use Cases:**
- Show name and issuer, hide dates
- Reveal organization, hide serial number
- Custom privacy-preserving certificate sharing

**API Endpoint:** `POST /zk/selective_disclosure`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "serial_number": "1111",
  "owner_secret": "my_private_key_123",
  "disclosed_attributes": ["name", "organization"]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "disclosure_id": "def456...",
  "disclosed_attributes": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "organization": "Acme Corp"
  },
  "hidden_attributes_count": 5,
  "message": "Selective disclosure created successfully"
}
```

---

### 4. **⚡ Batch Verification**
Verify multiple ZK proofs simultaneously.

**Use Cases:**
- Employer verifying multiple candidates' certificates
- Bulk certificate verification
- Efficient multi-certificate authentication

**API Endpoint:** `POST /zk/batch_verify`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "proof_ids": ["abc123", "xyz789", "def456"]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "total": 3,
  "verified_count": 3,
  "results": [
    {
      "proof_id": "abc123",
      "verified": true,
      "timestamp": "2025-10-25T12:00:00",
      "type": "ownership"
    },
    {
      "proof_id": "xyz789",
      "verified": true,
      "timestamp": "2025-10-25T12:05:00",
      "type": "attr_"
    }
  ]
}
```

   - Choose predicate type
   - Enter comparison value
   - Generate proof without revealing actual value

3. **🎭 Selective Disclosure Tab**
   - Checkbox selection for attributes to disclose
   - Real-time preview of disclosed data
   - Hidden attributes count display

4. **⚡ Batch Verify Tab**
   - Comma-separated proof IDs input

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### **Example 1: Job Application**

**Scenario:** Prove you have a valid certificate without revealing sensitive details.

```
1. Generate Ownership Proof
   - Serial Number: 1111
   - Owner Secret: my_private_key
   
2. System returns: proof_id = abc123...

3. Share proof_id with employer

4. Employer verifies: "Certificate ownership confirmed ✅"
   (Without seeing your private key!)
```

### **Example 2: University Admission**

**Scenario:** Prove completion date is recent without exact date.

```
1. Attribute Proof
   - Serial Number: 555
   - Attribute: completion_date
   - Predicate: greater_than
   - Value: 2024-01-01

2. System verifies: "Completion date is after 2024-01-01 ✅"
   (Without revealing exact date!)
```

### **Example 3: Privacy-Preserving Verification**

**Scenario:** Share specific info, keep rest private.

```
1. Selective Disclosure
   - Serial Number: 668
   - Owner Secret: my_key
   - Disclosed: [name, organization]
   - Hidden: [dates, issuer, serial_number]

2. Result:
   ✅ Disclosed: Name, Organization
   🔒 Hidden: 5 attributes with ZK commitments
```

## 📊 Security Considerations

### **What ZK Proofs Protect:**
✅ Private keys/secrets
✅ Exact attribute values
✅ Sensitive personal information
✅ Certificate metadata

### **What is Revealed:**
- Proof that ownership exists
- Proof that predicate is satisfied
- Selected disclosed attributes (in selective disclosure)
- Cryptographic commitments (hash values)

### **Best Practices:**
1. **Keep owner secrets secure** - Never share your private key
2. **Use strong secrets** - Minimum 16 characters, random
3. **Verify proof IDs** - Always check returned proof IDs
4. **Time-limited proofs** - Consider adding expiration times
5. **Secure communication** - Use HTTPS in production
